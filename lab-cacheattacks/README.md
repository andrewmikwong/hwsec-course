# Hands-On Hardware Side Channels Lab

This repository contains all the starting code you will need for the lab. 

## Starting the Lab

As stated on the lab handout, you must first change the `SENDER_CPU` and `RECEIVER_CPU` variables in the Makefile to your assigned CPUs. These will be emailed to you along with your lab machine password when the lab is released. **Double check that you have set these values correctly.**

After completing these steps, you are now ready to start the lab. Good luck!
